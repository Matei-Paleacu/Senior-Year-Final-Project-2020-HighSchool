# Senior-Year-Final-Project-2020-HighSchool
This project was made in my final year of high school for my coding class as our final project. This was also done with a partner from the class. 
It is a web based website that we made for our school where you could book your locker for the year instead of having to come to school the week before summer break was over. This was beneficial for both the students and the faculty as is saved time and money.
